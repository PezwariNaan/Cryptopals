# Cryptopals Crypto Challenges

Welcome to my Cryptopals Crypto Challenges repository! This is a collection of solutions for the [Cryptopals Cryptography Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/), a series of programming challenges that are designed to teach cryptographic concepts through hands-on practice.

## üìú About Cryptopals Challenges

The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges are a well-known set of cryptography exercises that start with beginner-friendly concepts and progressively introduce more complex topics in cryptography. The challenges cover a range of cryptographic techniques, including block ciphers, stream ciphers, key exchange protocols, and more. Created by cryptography experts, these challenges are a fun and practical way to deepen understanding in this fascinating field.

## üìå Repository Overview

This repository contains my solutions and code for each challenge, organized by sets as outlined on the Cryptopals website. Each set introduces new concepts and techniques, gradually building on previous sets to increase difficulty and understanding.

## üõ† Technologies

- **C++**: The primary language used to solve the challenges.  
- **Python 3**: Used for Base64 encoding and decoding until I debug mine üòÖ
- **Cryptography Libraries**: OpenSSL

## üìù Acknowledgments
